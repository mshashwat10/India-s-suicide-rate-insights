#presinstalled R data

head(bicoal)   # provides first few instances of the data
head(bicoal,10) #provides first 10 instances of the data
autoplot(bicoal) #little upward and downward trend occasionaly



#================== Forecasting - Average method ================


### Average as forecast

# Description: the beer data has monthly Australian beer production 1/91 - 8/95

head(beer) #displays first few lines of the data

summary(beer) #descriptive statistics

plot(beer)

meanf(beer,1)
meanf(beer,5)

#Naive Method

naive(beer,1)
naive(beer, 5)

rwf(beer,5) #equivalent random walk

###Linear Regression

head(books) #displays first few lines of the data

summary(books) #descriptive statistics

mean(books)


autoplot(books, ylab="Sales",xlab="Time", size=1)

#trying to check effect of hardcover books sales on paperback sales
#because in reality hardcover books are published first and once
#they are successful in terms of sales then paperback are published
#Y is paperback sales and X is Hardcover sales

fit <- lm(Paperback ~ Hardcover, data=books)  #Fit a linear regression model

summary(fit)
# as per the linear model output Hardcover is not significant(p-value) in explaining
# Y or paperback sales, intercept is significant

plot(Paperback ~ Hardcover, data=books, pch=19)
