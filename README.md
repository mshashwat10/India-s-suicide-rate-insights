# 1. Paperback vs Hardcover

The data set used here is Books, it has Sales data of the paperback and hardcover books. In general hardcover books are 
published first so as part of the data analysis I am building a linear regression model to identify the effect of hardcover book
sales on paperback book sales.This is useful in terms of estimating the sales for paperback books and the information can be 
used for identifying the optimal no of books to be published.

After seeing the results, we can see Hardcover(x) is not significant(p-value < 0.05) in predicting sales for Hardcover(y)
